python files for real Data preprocessing are saved in Anomaly_Detection/input_2/ 
python files for abnormal Data generation are saved in Anomaly_Detection/Generation/

after real Data preprocessing and abnormal Data generation, we get the data, which are saved in Anomaly_Detection/input_2/Generation_data and Anomaly_Detection/input_2/Real_data. these data are what the model file need.

python files for 3 Model are saved in Anomaly_Detection/Model/, in these files the data will be processed one last time, and feedded to the model.
the results will also be showed in these files.

all files about real accident test(input, output, model, results) are saved independently in Anomaly_Detection/Real_Accident/

we show all input data and output data on the map. The maps are saved at Anomaly_Detection/input_2/Map/ and Anomaly_Detection/Real_Accident/Map/
